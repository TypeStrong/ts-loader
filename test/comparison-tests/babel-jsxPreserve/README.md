This test demonstrates the new JSX functionality of TypeScript.

Note that React is not actually bundled here.

This particular test demonstrates the "preserve" capability of TypeScript. In order to be
used with React it needs to be further transformed with Babel (as seen in this example).

See [this blog post](http://www.jbrantly.com/typescript-and-jsx/) for more information about JSX in TypeScript.
