## v3.3.0

* [Replaced option `contextAsConfigBasePath` with `context` option.](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/pull/688/) Strictly speaking a breaking change. However, given the original option was never able to fulfil its intended purpose I've decided to treat this as just a new feature; there seems no possibility that anyone can be using `contextAsConfigBasePath` - thanks @christiantinauer!
* [Added support for the new watch api of TypeScript compiler.](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/pull/685) nb This feature has been placed behind a new `experimentalWatchApi` option until it has been thoroughly tested.

## v3.2.0

* [Add new loader option `contextAsConfigBasePath`](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/pull/681) - thanks @christiantinauer

* [Chore release; upgraded chalk dependency in `package.json` to 2.3, as 2.3 is another breaking changes release (from a TypeScript perspective).](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/issues/664), see [here](https://github.com/chalk/chalk/issues/215) for context - thanks @johnnyreilly

## v3.0.5

* [Chore release; upgraded chalk dependency in `package.json` to 2.2, as 2.2 appears to be a breaking changes release.](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/issues/664) - thanks @lmk123 for reporting

## v3.0.4

* [Chore release; upgraded chalk dependency.](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/pull/662) - thanks @johnnyreilly

## v3.0.3

* [Fix allowJs @types resolution error](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/pull/658) (#657, #655) - thanks @johnnyreilly and @roddypratt + @ldrick for providing minimal repro repos which allowed me to fix this long standing bug!

This fix resolves the issue for TypeScript 2.4+ (which is likely 95% of users). For those people stuck on 2.3 or below and impacted by this issue, you should be able to workaround this by setting `entryFileCannotBeJs: true` in your ts-loader options. This option should be considered deprecated as of this release. The option will likely disappear with the next major version of ts-loader which will drop support for TypeScript 2.3 and below, thus removing the need for this option.

## v3.0.0

All changes were made with this [PR](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/pull/643) - thanks @johnnyreilly

([Published to npm as v3.0.2 due to npm publishing issues](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/issues/654)) thanks @mattlewis92 for noticing!

* drop support for typescript < 2.0 (no-one seems to be using it and we can simplify the code) **BREAKING CHANGE**
* remove `entryFileIsJs` option; it can be inferred from whether the `allowJs` TypeScript compiler option has been set.
* move to webpack 3.0 for test harness
* drop `configFileName` support [(replaced by `configFile`)](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/pull/607) **BREAKING CHANGE**
* add support for a custom formatter for output - drop visual studio format (this can be added back if there's clamour for it and people can supply their own formatters in the interim) **BREAKING CHANGE**
* make loglevel warn by default (stop outputting typescript version number by default). Fixes [#488](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/issues/488)
* fix [tsc has "module" default to "es2015"when targetting es2015+, but ts-loader does not](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/issues/570) - thanks [@Venryx](https://github.com/Venryx) for the suggestion!
* [switch to build ts-loader / run tests with yarn](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/issues/369) because of [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45022048/why-does-npm-install-rewrite-package-lock-json/45566871#45566871)

* [Use native Object.assign()](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/pull/418) - thanks @arusakov

Breaking changes:

* ts-loader now officially only supports webpack 2. ts-loader 2.x may work with webpack 1 but it is not supported. Related to that, all continuous integration tests now run against webpack 2.
* as webpack 2 does not support node 0.12 neither does ts-loader from now. node 4 at least is required.

## v1.3.3

* [Fix bug when "extend"ing a tsconfig that specifies "allowJs"](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/pull/415) Thanks @cspotcode
* [Minor perf optimisations](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/pull/412)

## v1.3.2

* [Upgrade enhanced-resolve to v3](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/pull/411)
* [Remove arrify dependency](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/pull/410)

## v1.3.1

* [Rolled back re-exported const enums no longer break emit in watch mode as performance cost was too high](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/pull/406) resolves #393

## v1.3.0

* [Introduce meaningful error when importing TypeScript from `node_modules`](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/pull/399)
* [Introduce `entryFileIsJs` loader option which allows having an entry file which is js.](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/pull/399) resolves #388 and #401 - thanks @Wykks and @pqr.

NB Previously the `entryFileIsJs` option was on by default when `allowJs` was true. Now it has to be specified directly. Strictly speaking this is a breaking change; however given this is a rarely used option which exists for what is arguably an edge case this is being added without moving to 2.0. If this breaks people then we'll never do this again; I'd be surprised if anyone is relying on this though so we're taking a chance. Related tests have been suffixed "-entryFileIsJs" in the test name.

  See the [aliasResolution test](test/aliasResolution) for an example. Only supported in TS 1.6 and
  above.

    will now be correctly reported as an error in the dependent file.
  * Errors with TypeScript options are now reported as webpack errors instead of logged to console
  * Error output no longer contains the filename once from webpack and again in the error message.
