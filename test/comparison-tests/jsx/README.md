This test demonstrates the new JSX functionality of TypeScript.

Note that the nightly build of TypeScript is required for this functionality to work.
Install `typescript@next` to use. Also note that React is not actually bundled here.

See [this blog post](http://www.jbrantly.com/typescript-and-jsx/) for more information about JSX in TypeScript.
