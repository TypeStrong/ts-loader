# TypeScript Project References Demo

This repo is forked from https://github.com/RyanCavanaugh/project-references-demo, which is a repo to demonstrate the use of project references in TypeScript.  It has been extended to show how project references can be used in a project using the following:

* TypeScript
* Webpack
* ts-loader
* yarn workspaces

This repo is described in the article [here](/REFERENCES.md).
