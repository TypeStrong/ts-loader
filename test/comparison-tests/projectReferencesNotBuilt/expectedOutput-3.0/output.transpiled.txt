ERROR in ./lib/index.ts
Module build failed (from /index.js):
Error: Could not find output JavaScript file for input lib\index.ts (looked at lib\index.js).
The input file is part of a project reference located at lib\tsconfig.json, so ts-loader is looking for the projectâ€™s pre-built output on disk. Try running `tsc --build` to build project references.
